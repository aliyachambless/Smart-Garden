# Smart-Watering-System
  My arduino project idea is a smart watering system for an outdoor plant. This device would be sensitive to rain and heat, and it could adjust the amount of water it releases to conseve water and keep the plant healthy. It could also collect rainwater to use later, in addition to manually filling the tank. 

  I would use a [soil moisture sensor] (http://www.elecrow.com/sensors-c-111/physical-monitor-c-111_125/soil-moisture-sensor-p-509.html) to monitor the water needs of the plant and adjust a [small pump] (http://www.elecrow.com/actuators-c-148/motor-servo-c-148_105/mini-water-pump-p-621.html) accordingly. 

  The device would be programmed to predict the amount of water needed in the near future by using online weather information and current soil conditions. If the water level is too low and no rain is predicted, it will notify you via text message or another method to remind you to fill the tank. If the weather is predicted to be harmful to your plant, it will notify you then too! 
  
  This device can also track the water usage on the plant and provide valuable information about water usage on yards and plants. It would not only be helpful in keeping your plant, but it also helps with water conservation. No water will be wasted, even extra rain will go to use!
